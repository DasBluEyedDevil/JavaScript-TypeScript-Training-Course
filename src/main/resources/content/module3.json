Forgetting parentheses with mixed operators:\n   if (a || b && c)  // Unclear!\n   if (a || (b && c))  // Better\n   if ((a || b) && c)  // Different meaning!\n\n4. Double negatives:\n   if (!!isLoggedIn)  // Just use: if (isLoggedIn)\n   Don't overthink it!\n\n5. Not understanding short-circuit:\n   if (user && user.name)  // Safe - checks user exists first\n   if (user.name && user)  // DANGEROUS - might error if user is null\n\n6. Trying to check multiple values at once:\n   if (x === 1 || 2 || 3)  // WRONG - doesn't work!\n   if (x === 1 || x === 2 || x === 3)  // CORRECT\n   Or better: if ([1,2,3].includes(x))  // We'll learn this later!"
