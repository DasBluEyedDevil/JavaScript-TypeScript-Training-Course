      "title": "Variables: Your Labeled Storage Boxes (let and const)",
      "conceptAnalogy": "Imagine you have a storage room with many boxes. Each box can hold one thing, and you put a label on each box so you remember what's inside.\n\n'Age: 25' - A box labeled 'Age' that contains the number 25\n'Name: Alice' - A box labeled 'Name' that contains the text 'Alice'\n'Is Student: true' - A box labeled 'Is Student' that contains the answer 'yes' (true)\n\nIn programming, these labeled boxes are called VARIABLES. A variable is just a named container that holds a piece of information. You create a variable, give it a name (the label), and store something in it (the contents).\n\nWhy are variables useful? Because you can create a box once and then use what's inside it many times throughout your code. If you need to change what's in the box, you change it in ONE place, and everywhere that uses that box automatically gets the new value.",
      "codeExample": "// Creating a variable with 'let'\n// 'let' means 'create a new box'\nlet age = 25;\nlet name = 'Alice';\nlet isStudent = true;\n\n// Now we can use these boxes!\nconsole.log(name);  // Displays: Alice\nconsole.log(age);   // Displays: 25\n\n// We can change what's inside a 'let' box\nage = 26;  // It's Alice's birthday!\nconsole.log(age);  // Displays: 26\n\n// Creating a variable with 'const'\n// 'const' means 'constant' - a box whose contents CANNOT change\nconst birthYear = 1998;\nconsole.log(birthYear);  // Displays: 1998\n\n// This would cause an ERROR:\n// birthYear = 1999;  // Can't change a const!",
      "syntaxBreakdown": "Let's break down the anatomy of creating a variable:\n\nlet age = 25;\n│   │   │ │\n│   │   │ └─ The value (what goes IN the box)\n│   │   └─── The equals sign (means 'store this value')\n│   └─────── The variable name (the label on the box)\n└─────────── The keyword 'let' (tells the computer to create a box)\n\nThink of it as: let [label] = [contents];\n\nTwo keywords for creating variables:\n\n1. let - Use this when the value might change later\n   - Example: let score = 0; (score will increase during a game)\n   \n2. const - Use this when the value will NEVER change\n   - Example: const PI = 3.14159; (pi is always pi)\n   - If you try to change a const, you'll get an error\n\nVariable naming rules:\n- Must start with a letter, $, or _\n- Can contain letters, numbers, $, or _ (but not spaces!)\n- Cannot be a reserved word (like 'let', 'const', 'if', etc.)\n- Case sensitive: 'age' and 'Age' are different variables\n\nNaming conventions (not required, but everyone does it):\n- Use camelCase: firstName, not firstname or first_name\n- Use descriptive names: userAge, not x or ua\n- Start with lowercase: age, not Age (unless it's a special case we'll learn later)",

      "commonStickingPoints": "Common mistakes:\n\n1. Forgetting 'let' or 'const': Writing just age = 25; instead of let age = 25; In strict mode, this causes an error.\n\n2. Using 'let' or 'const' when USING a variable: You only use 'let' or 'const' when CREATING the variable. After that, just use the name:\n   Correct: let age = 25; age = 26;\n   Wrong: let age = 25; let age = 26; (Can't create the same box twice!)\n\n3. Trying to change a 'const': Remember, const means 'constant'. Once set, it cannot be changed.\n\n4. Misspelling variable names: If you create 'userName' but later try to use 'username', JavaScript will say 'username is not defined' because it's looking for a box with that exact label.\n\n5. Not using quotes for text: let name = Alice; won't work. Text must be in quotes: let name = 'Alice';"

      "conceptAnalogy": "Just like in real life, we store different TYPES of things in different ways:\n\n- Words and sentences: We write them down as text (String)\n- Counting and measuring: We use numbers (Number)\n- Yes/No questions: We use true or false (Boolean)\n\nJavaScript has different 'types' of data for the same reason. Each type works differently and has different things you can do with it.\n\nThink of it like different types of storage containers:\n- A filing cabinet is for documents (text/strings)\n- A scale is for numbers (you can add, subtract, compare)\n- A light switch is for true/false (on or off, yes or no)\n\nYou wouldn't try to do math with words, and you wouldn't try to write a letter with numbers. JavaScript keeps track of what TYPE each variable is so it knows how to work with it.",
      "codeExample": "// STRINGS (text) - always in quotes\nlet firstName = 'Alice';\nlet lastName = \"Smith\";  // Single or double quotes both work\nlet greeting = 'Hello, World!';\n\n// You can join strings together with +\nlet fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;\nconsole.log(fullName);  // Displays: Alice Smith\n\n// NUMBERS - no quotes!\nlet age = 25;\nlet price = 19.99;  // Decimals are fine\nlet temperature = -5;  // Negative numbers too\n\n// You can do math with numbers\nlet total = price + 10;\nconsole.log(total);  // Displays: 29.99\n\n// BOOLEANS (true or false) - no quotes!\nlet isStudent = true;\nlet hasGraduated = false;\nlet isRaining = true;\n\nconsole.log(isStudent);  // Displays: true\n\n// A common mistake: don't put quotes around booleans!\nlet wrong = 'true';  // This is a STRING containing the word 'true'\nlet right = true;    // This is a BOOLEAN with the value true",
      "syntaxBreakdown": "The three basic data types:\n\n1. STRING - Text\n   - Always enclosed in quotes (single ' or double \")\n   - Can be empty: let empty = '';\n   - Can contain numbers as text: let code = '12345';\n   - Use + to join strings: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' = 'Hello World'\n\n2. NUMBER - Numeric values\n   - NO quotes\n   - Can be positive, negative, or decimal\n   - Can do math: +, -, *, / (division), % (remainder)\n   - Special values: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN (Not a Number)\n\n3. BOOLEAN - True or False\n   - Only two possible values: true or false\n   - NO quotes (quotes would make it a string)\n   - Used for yes/no, on/off, exists/doesn't exist\n   - We'll use these a lot when making decisions (if statements)\n\nHow to remember:\n- If it's text, it needs quotes → String\n- If it's a number for math, no quotes → Number\n- If it's true or false, no quotes → Boolean\n\nThe + operator:\n- With numbers: 5 + 3 = 8 (addition)\n- With strings: 'Hello' + 'World' = 'HelloWorld' (joining)\n- Mixed: 'Age: ' + 25 = 'Age: 25' (converts number to string and joins)",

Quotes around booleans: let isStudent = 'true'; makes it a STRING containing the word 'true', not the boolean value true.\n\n3. Forgetting quotes around text: let name = Alice; won't work. JavaScript thinks Alice is a variable, not text. Use let name = 'Alice';\n\n4. Mixing up + for numbers vs strings:\n   - 5 + 5 = 10 (math)\n   - '5' + '5' = '55' (joining strings)\n   - '5' + 5 = '55' (JavaScript converts the number to a string)\n\n5.
